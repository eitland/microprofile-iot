# Introduction

So what is actually happening here?

We are moving to a new office, and we of course want to be modern and cool while doing that. So, we decided to dive into the world of Internet of Things.

In an office, we would of course need lightning, so we thought that it might be a good starting point for introducing the IoT. However controlling the on and off switch via the Internet is a bit too simple, so we decided to take it one step further.
 
And as we all know, people tend to be more sleepy, or feeling less productive at some times of the day, or in some specific situations. For instance, early mornings is the time when you often feel a bit more sleepy. Fortunately, we can help with that by introducing special lighting (and coffee...) to make you feel a bit more awake! 
In the afternoons, when you've been working hard for many hours already and it's getting dark outside, you might need a bit more warm and bright light.
Or just imagine if it is freezing cold outside, and you would love to have some warm, intense lighting while working hard on that deadline that is just a few days away.

Fear not! We have got your back, we have git some light bulbs that can be controlled with bits and bytes. Many of you might have already used these â€“ it is the Philips Hue bulbs. These are the bulbs that can for instance be controlled via an app on your phone.

However, as we are a company of geeks, we don't want to sit and control these manually every day. So we need a system to help us during the day.

# The Architecture

#### Facade, or Anti-corruption layer
Let's start from the beginning: controlling the light bulbs. Philips have made an SDK, available as jar files.

However, the API is a bit complicated and challenging to work with. It's also subject to change without us being able to control it. So we decided to create a module wrapping the SDK. This gives us the ability to control which calls are made to the bulbs, and it also acts as an _anti-corruption layer_, preventing the library's code and terms to leak into the our system.  We're using the term _facade_ for this module.

#### Maven ####
Maven is the building system we are most familiar with, so we use it for the facade as well. The Hue SDK is not available in Maven central, 
at least not yet, so we figured we had to do something smart for the code to compile with Maven. Hence, we have made a local maven repository, 
and added the SDK to this. Yes, it was somewhat hassle getting started with, but there are some good guides online. 
Also, when it's first properly setup, it just works and keeps working.

This way, we have produced a facade for the SDK that exposes two operations: 
- get the number of registered light bulbs
- switch the brightness and colour of a given light bulb

The original SDK is much more intricate and feature-rich, so we have simplified into just these.


#### MicroProfile
But where are the MicroProfile usage, you might be wondering? Don't worry, we'll come to that.

And what _is_ MicroProfile? JakartaEE for microservices, easily said.

While Jakarta EE is a great toolbox for more monolithic architectures, it is a bit overkill for microservices. 
MicroProfile is a more right-sied toolkit for microservices.
 
It also bears with it a lot of standardization efforts, to allow for easier replacement of specific tools 
and thus reduce vendor lock-in 


#### Gateway
To control the facade, we have built a gateway, as a separate microservice.

This is the service that actually decides what light we shall have. Its major responsibility is to get input, 
transform it into what they should mean for our lights, and then tell the facade what to do.

The gateway talks with two different input providers:

#### Weather
The default one is the weather service. This service gets the weather forecast for the given area, and extracts the temperature.

#### Time
The other input provider is the time service. This service simply gets the current time.

It's the gateway's responsibility to transform the temperature or time into light implications.


# TODO from here: incorporate #

# MicroProfile #

Things to talk about from the facade
* CDI all around
* The logger producer trick
* Docker container
* The JAX-RS stuff that just works
* Same thing with the JSON-P stuff that just works
* Switch state of light in WildflyEntryPoint should be annotated with OpenAPI stuff...
* ... which leads to a part about Wildfly Swarm


#### Possibly also some words about ####
* Lombok
* The wrapExceptions hack and ThrowingSupplier
* preferIPv4Stack
* docker-compose


# Gateway #
* Rest client hack to be able to control the facade - 
this indicates that MicroProfile as well as its implementations still is a young technology so that everything is not yet mature.
However, certain features we have made use of were not available when we started the preparations for this presentation 
- for instance, OpenAPI were included in the Wildfly Swarm implementation just a couple of weeks ago.
* Actually, the next version of MicroProfile, 1.4, is released _today_. This release is focused on improving documentation and tutorials.
As of today, well, as of yesterday, the documentation available is somewhat fractured and hard to find.
* Retry + fallback (HttpConnector::getCloseableHttpResponse)
* Config - f.ex. HueURL or TimeRestConnector
* Health check
* The conversion between the data from the services into a light bulb control direction
* Metrics are automagically available at /metrics



# Round-up #

As you have seen, we have used a lot of the features included in MicroProfile in this project. 
However, there are some we haven't exploited.
* Rest client, as mentioned
* JWT authentication
* OpenTracing
